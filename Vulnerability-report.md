#Weak Account Vulnerabilites 

These vulnerabilies put users account and information at risk
- We did not make sure that cookies were sent with httpOnly. 
this is a line that would be in the app.UseCookieAuthentication

CookieHttpOnly = true,

-Did not reduce the time for a session expiration and remove slidingExpiration
which prevents the renewal of the expiration time on an authentication cookie if a request 
is made before more than half the time out interval has elapsed.

ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(60),
    SlidingExpiration = false

-We did not protect the Login, Registration methods from brute force attacks. This can 
be fixed by throttling requests meaning making it so only a certain number of requests can be 
made in a given period of time. 

-Did not make sure any cookies sent over the production environment are sent through https.

#Cross site request forgery
-We did not send an ani-forgery token with every Post request.
