##Vulnerability 3 - Cross Site Scripting
We found that XSS could be exploited by typing malicious javascript in our input fields. This would allow someone to retrieve hidden information or change Inspector names.

We can fix it by using encoders to encode our inputs in our create.cshtml views.

```csharp
	HtmlEncoder _htmlEncoder;
```
