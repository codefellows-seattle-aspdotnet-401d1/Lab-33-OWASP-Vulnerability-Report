## Vulnerability 1
### Exposure
<p> We found an instance of cross sote scripting (XSS) by typing some malicious javascript into any of our input fields.</p>

Using the built in encoders contained in System.Text.Encodings.Web could help us fix this using something like this:

```csharp
	HtmlEncoder _htmlEncoder;
```
